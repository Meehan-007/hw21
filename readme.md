# Apex Smoothies

## Description
Apex Smoothies is a health-focused smoothie bar that wanted an app to expand their presence and branding. I developed an app that allows users to explore the menu and learn about the nutritional information of each smoothie. The source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.

## Deployment:

## Code and Technologies:
The app is built using Node.js, Sequelize, Express.js, and React.

## Licenses:
The source code is licensed under the MIT license.

## Features:
In the future, I plan to add a payment portal that will allow users to purchase smoothies online and pick them up in-store. This feature will enhance the user experience and provide a more convenient way for customers to buy smoothies.
