# Book App 

## Description 

The Book App is a web application that allows users to search for any book using a third-party API from Google. With a simple search, users can find information about any book they want, including the title, author, and description.

## Deployment 

The app is deployed at https://book-powers-4us.herokuapp.com/.

## Code and Technologies 

The app is built using Node.js, Mongoose, Express.js, and React.

## Licenses 

The source code is licensed under the MIT license.

## Features 

The Book App's main feature is its ability to search for any book using the Google Books API. Users can enter a book's title, author, or keywords, and the app will return a list of matching books. Each book in the list includes a thumbnail image, title, author, and a brief description. Users can also click on a book to view more detailed information about it.

In addition to searching for books, users can sign up with a secure login using bcrypt. Once signed in, they can save books to their "saved books" list and remove books from the list.
